# Maker Block Party (Title Pending) Action Plan

This genuinely hand written action plan that needs to be accomplished before the event, with set deadlines please feel free to add on to this document.

Also, this event is a pilot, and is intended to lead to a greater event next year.

## Summary

**Maker Block Party Is** conceived as a preliminary communal festival that integrates Art with STEM, making it an event that brings together students across art, art media, and art history to collaboratively build tools, platforms, and ideas that support **contemporary artistic practice**.

Initially this event was planned as a hackathon, and as such, the event aims to connect the general student body with art the department (students and faculty), their university, their local community and beyond. A key goal is to align students with a network of peers, mentors and careers.

While competition is not necessary for this for this first iteration, it is not out of the picture, and we would like to explore how we could make a competition work in our time frame, and if it would be easier to incorporate existing events this semester like **Cadathon** already being worked on by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics & 3D Printing and Assistive Technology for Health.

As a pilot event, our goal is to use the lessons learned and connections built this year to develop a framework for a flagship, fully realized version of this festival in the future.

### This is a preliminary event for the art department designed to:

1.  Get interdisciplinary engagement between the Art Depart and Stem on campus.
2.  Network our student with both their fellow student and faculty within the depart; but also the outside individuals, organizations, companies, and educational institutions, to help better lines up our student with their careers outside of their undergrad, and sponsor the event.
3.  Demonstrate the capabilities of our department's faculty through workshops, demo and keynotes.
4.  Helper better connect, both the students and faculty, with other creative resources on campus, like our maker space, etc.
5.  Develop a framework for a potentially much more successful and fully realized version of this event in the following year due to the groundwork of this event.
6.  Most importantly, **HAVE FUN AND ENGAGE** with our student base, the art department, so they can reap the benefits of these objectives.

## Primary Components

### Core Infrastructure (Reserved by 02/21)

*   **24-Hour Internet Café (Ongoing)**
    *   This space functions as the social spine of the event.
        *   Creates a continuous, welcoming commons.
        *   Supports endurance without glorifying burnout.
        *   Encourages drop-in participation.
    *   **What It Includes**
        *   Coffee, tea, and snacks (VERY IMPORTANT).
        *   Reliable Wi-Fi, power strips, and work tables.
        *   Open access for the full duration of the event.
        *   Light facilitation rather than supervision.
    *   This space is essential to making the hackathon feel humane and specific to an art-school culture. Ideal space: Black box theater (or similar flexible, comfortable environments such as the SAC ballrooms).
*   **An area to hold keynotes for guest speakers**
    *   One short invited talk (ideally following the Idea Exchange session).
    *   Visiting artist remains present for informal conversation and feedback, most likely have their own table.
*   **An area for booth and Demos**
    *   This could be a shared area with our cafe, but it is a space where our visiting talent can have their own booth, and do live demonstrations of their work.
*   **A room for workshops**
    *   Workshops will be run throughout the event, a good portion will probably require their own class like space to run.

### Volunteers (Needed ASAP)

*   A core group of student teachers should be developed to volunteer and make the event run smoothly.

### A Website (02/15)

*   I would like to build a website that helps cleanly presents the details of the event in an artistic styling.
    *   **Example Websites**
        *   MakeMIT
        *   TreeHacks (Stanford)

### University Out Reach (Starts 03/02)

*   Probably Needs it's own dedicated person.
    *   Creating flyers and emails to notify students about the event.
    *   Have faculty tell there students about the event.

### The Competition

*   As mentioned, if we like to run a competition, we could collaborate with Cadathon being run by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics & 3D Printing and Assistive Technology for Health (reached out to by 02/08).
*   Additionally, I would like to incorporate SBU's Central Services Surplus, so we could give new life to bin of technology that would just end up in the landfill as a component of the competition.

### Potential Workshops, Key Notes, Tabling and Demonstrations

These organizations would need to be reached out to individually, which will probably require a few people if we would like to exhaust this list.

*   Primarily this will be an opportunity to showcase work of our department's many faculty and classes in the department, so we should reach out to them first.
*   There are **733 Organizations** listed on StonyBrook.campuslabs.
*   **Potential organizations that might be interested in participating might be:**
    *   The Robotics Team, Solar Racing, Girls Who Code College LOOPs, Embroidery Club, Crochet Club, Art Club, Fine Arts Organization, Artists in Medicine, Quiz Bowl And Trivia Club, Retro Gaming Board, Rhythm Gaming Board, Computing Society at Stony Brook, Game Development & Design Club, Make up Artists of SBU, SBU-TV And Film Productions, WUSB Radio Station, Stony Music Rocks, Music Makers, etc.
*   **Additionally There are quite a few Maker/Creative Spaces that would like to show their work (Will reachout to these by 02/15):**
    *   The Space @ Engineering, The Cat Lab @ the Library, The Film studio @ Information systems, The Teaching & Learning Lab @ The Library, The Third Space @ Staller, The Future History Studio @Staller.

### There are also plenty of similar events where we could find both locals and known creators and sponsors who can participate:

*   **Local**
    *   I was looking into local events, and the university happens to be hosting Makerfaire Long Island with The Long Island Explorium over the summer, perhaps there could be some overlap in attendees (**Will reachout to these by 02/15**).
    *   Wonderville is arcade located in Brooklyn is arcade where every game is independent and often built on custom hardware by local creators.
